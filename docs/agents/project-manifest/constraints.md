# Constraints & Conventions

## TypeScript Import Extensions

All relative imports **must** include the `.js` extension:

```typescript
// Correct
import { MyClass } from './my-module.js';

// Wrong — compile error + runtime failure
import { MyClass } from './my-module';
```

This is a strict requirement of the `Node16` module resolution setting. TypeScript maps `.js` → `.ts` at compile time and emits `.js` unchanged for Node.js at runtime.

## Git Subprocess Security

- All Git commands use `shell: false` — no shell expansion, globbing, or metacharacter processing.
- Arguments are passed as a typed `string[]` directly to `spawn()`.
- Error messages use only `args[0]` (the subcommand name), never the full args array, to avoid leaking credential-bearing URLs.
- `RepositoryManager.add()` redacts embedded credentials from URLs before interpolating into error messages.

## Stateless Managers

All model managers (`RepositoryManager`, `ProjectManager`, `WorkspaceManager`) re-read their backing JSON file from disk on **every** public method call. There is no in-memory cache. This ensures concurrent writes from other processes are always reflected.

## ID Validation Rules

| Entity | Format | Validation Function |
|---|---|---|
| Repository ID | Lowercase kebab-case (`a-z0-9`, segments separated by `-`) | `isValidKebabCase()` |
| Project ID | Lowercase kebab-case | `isValidKebabCase()` |
| Workspace ID | 2–6 uppercase ASCII letters (`A-Z`) | `isValidWorkspaceId()` |

Path-traversal sequences, uppercase characters (for kebab-case IDs), spaces, and other invalid formats are rejected with a descriptive error.

## The STABLE Workspace Invariant

Every project has exactly one workspace with ID `"STABLE"`. It is auto-created when a project is created and **cannot be removed or renamed**. The STABLE workspace is intended for the remote's default branch.

## Path Resolution

Both `storageFolder` and `projectsFolder` in `config.json` accept relative or absolute paths:

- **Relative paths** are resolved against the tool root (directory containing `package.json`), regardless of the current working directory when the tool is invoked.
- **Absolute paths** are used as-is.

## Configuration

- `config.json` is created by copying `config.dist.json`. It is not committed (gitignored).
- The `_instructions` key in `config.dist.json` is an editorial note and is not a valid config field. Remove it from `config.json`.
- `initializeStorage()` is idempotent — re-running it does not overwrite existing files.

## Test Conventions

- **Test runner:** Node.js built-in test runner (`node --test`).
- **Cleanup:** All tests creating temporary files must register a `process.on('exit')` handler for synchronous cleanup, in addition to `afterAll`. The `'exit'` event fires on `SIGINT` or crash.
- **Network tests:** Tests requiring outbound internet set `SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS=1` to self-skip.

## GUI Frontend Conventions

- **Router injection:** Views needing programmatic navigation export `setRouter(router)` and receive the router via dependency injection from `app.js`. Direct imports of `router.js` from views are forbidden (circular dependency).
- **Cleanup contract:** Views with side-effects (intervals, event listeners) must return a cleanup function from their render entry point. The router calls it before rendering the next view.
- **No framework:** Vanilla JavaScript with ES modules. No build step for the frontend.
- **JSON key normalisation:** The backend uses PascalCase keys (`Id`, `Name`, `Url`). The `normalise.js` utility maps them to camelCase for frontend use.

## Build Output

- Compiled output goes to `dist/`. Source maps are generated alongside each `.js` file.
- `dist/` is excluded from version control.
- `dist/index.js` does not carry the executable bit after `tsc`. Use `npm link` or `node dist/index.js`.

## Request Body Limit

`parseJsonBody()` enforces a **1 MB** request body size limit.

## Timeout Constants

| Constant | Value | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| `CLONE_TIMEOUT_MS` | 120,000 ms (2 min) | `cloneRepository()` via orchestrators |
| `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30,000 ms (30 sec) | `fetchRemote()` via polling and branch operations |

## Type-Audit Acceptance Criterion

Any work package that adds or modifies exported types must include the following acceptance criterion:

> **Type audit:** Exported types match the plan specification — verify that each new/modified interface property name, type, and optionality align with the plan before marking the WP complete.

QA work packages that follow implementation WPs should cross-check type signatures against the plan, paying particular attention to optional (`?`) vs. required properties and union types.

## Known Input Validation Gaps

- `branchExists()` and `fetchRemote()` do not validate the `'-'` prefix guard that `createBranch()` and `switchBranch()` enforce. These are lower-risk (no data-loss path) and a guard is planned for a future cleanup.
- `branchName` in `branchExists()` is not validated against a safe refname pattern — a path-traversal value may yield a false-positive. Callers must validate before passing untrusted input.
